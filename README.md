## Getting started

To get started with Commerce Layer JS Auth, you need to install it and add it to your project.

### Installation

Commerce Layer JS Auth is available as an npm package.

```
// npm
npm install @commercelayer/js-auth

// yarn
yarn add @commercelayer/js-auth
```

### Using ES6 import

You can use either the ES6 default or single/multiple named import with the SDK as follow:

```
import CLayerAuth from '@commercelayer/js-auth'

// or

import {
  getSalesChannelToken,
  getCustomerToken,
  getIntegrationToken,
  authorizeWebapp,
  getWebappToken
} from '@commercelayer/js-auth'
```

> In the examples below, we will use the latter solution (named import) and define only the functions we need, based on what kind of app and authorization flow we're going to use.

## Authorization flows

To get an access token, you need to execute an [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization flow by using a valid application as the client.

| Grant type             | Sales channel | Integration | Webapp |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Client credentials** | ✅            | ✅          |        |
| **Password**           | ✅            |             |        |
| **Refresh token**      | ✅            |             | ✅     |
| **Authorization code** |               |             | ✅     |

> Remember that, for security reasons, access tokens expire after **2 hours**. Authorization codes expire after **10 minutes**.

Check our [documentation](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication) for further information on each single authorization flow.

## Use cases

Based on the authorization flow and application you want to use, you can get your access token in a few simple steps. These are the most common use cases:

- [Sales channel application with client credentials flow](#sales-channel-client-credentials)
- [Sales channel application with password flow](#sales-channel-password)
- [Integration application with client credentials flow](#integration-client-credentials)
- [Webapp application with authorization code flow](#webapp-authorization-code)

### Sales channel (client credentials)

Sales channel applications use the [client credentials](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication/client-credentials) grant type to get a "guest" access token.

#### Steps

1. Create a **sales channel** application on Commerce Layer and take note of your API credentials (base endpoint, client ID, and the ID of the market you want to put in scope)

2. Use this code to get your access token:

   ```
   const token = await getSalesChannelToken({
       clientId: 'your-client-id',
       endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io',
       scope: 'market:{id}'
     })

   console.log('My access token: ', token.accessToken)
   console.log('Expiration date: ', token.expires)
   ```

### Sales channel (password)

Sales channel applications can use the [password](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication/password) grant type to exchange a customer credentials for an access token (i.e., to get a "logged" access token).

#### Steps

1. Create a **sales channel** application on Commerce Layer and take note of your API credentials (base endpoint, client ID, and the ID of the market you want to put in scope)

2. Use this code (changing user name and password with the customer credentials) to get the access token:

   ```
   const token = await getCustomerToken(
     {
       clientId: 'your-client-id',
       endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io',
       scope: 'market:{id}'
     },
     {
       username: 'john@example.com',
       password: 'secret'
     }
   )

   console.log('My access token: ', token.accessToken)
   console.log('Expiration date: ', token.expires)
   ```

Sales channel applications can use the [refresh token](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication/refresh-token) grant type to refresh a customer access token with a "remember me" option. So, in this case, if the token is expired, you can refresh it by using the `refresh()` method:

```
const newToken = await token.refresh()

console.log('New access token: ', newToken.accessToken)

// or

const newToken = await getRefreshToken(
  {
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io',
    scope: 'market:{id}',
    refreshToken: 'your-refresh-token'
  }
)

```

### Integration (client credentials)

Integration applications use the [client credentials](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication/client-credentials) grant type to get an access token for themselves.

#### Steps

1. Create an **integration** application on Commerce Layer and take note of your API credentials (client ID, client secret, and base endpoint)

2. Use this code to get the access token:

   ```
   const token = await getIntegrationToken({
     clientId: 'your-client-id',
     clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
     endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io'
   })

   console.log('My access token: ', token.accessToken)
   console.log('Expiration date: ', token.expires)
   ```

### Webapp (authorization code)

> Available only for browser applications

Webapp applications use the [authorization code](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/authentication/authorization-code) grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token.

#### Steps

In this case, first, you need to get an authorization code, then you can exchange it with an access token:

1. Create a **webapp** application on Commerce Layer and take note of your API credentials (client ID, client secret, callback URL, base endpoint, and the ID of the market you want to put in scope)

2. Use this code to open a new window and authorize your webapp on Commerce Layer:

   ```
   authorizeWebapp({
     clientId: 'your-client-id',
     clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
     callbackUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/callback',
     endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io',
     scope: 'market:{id}'
   })
   ```

3. Once you've authorized the application, you will be redirected to the callback URL:

   ![Callback URL with Authorization Code](docs/images/auth-code-browser.jpg?raw=true 'Callback URL with Authorization Code')

   Use this code to get the access token:

   ```
   const token = await getWebappToken({
     clientId: 'your-client-id',
     clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
     callbackUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/callback',
     endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.commercelayer.io',
     scope: 'market:{id}',
     callbackUrlWithCode: 'https://yourdomain.com/callback?code=your-auth-code' // triggers the access token request
   })

   console.log('My access token: ', token.accessToken)
   console.log('Expiration date: ', token.expires)
   ```
